# Speedrun Clock

This is a simple clock in c++ that you can use to speedrun games. 
You can save your splits and times to a file once you finish the run.

# Instructions
Start the clock from the command line.

Whenever you want to make a split, type any letter and press "enter", and the clock will store your split and display it to you.
At the end of your run, type "." and press "enter" and the run will end.

Then just type in the name of the file where you would like the splits to be saved.
